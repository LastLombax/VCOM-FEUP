--Automated Lung Nodule Detection and Classification Using Deep Learning 
Combined with Multiple Strategies

we have used two deep three-dimensional (3D) customized mixed link network (CMixNet) 
architectures for lung nodule detection and classification, respectively. 
Nodule detections were performed through faster R-CNN on efficiently-learned 
features from CMixNet and U-Net like encoderâ€“decoder architecture. 
Classification of the nodules was performed through a gradient boosting machine (GBM) 
on the learned features from the designed 3D CMixNet structure.

An Appraisal of Lung Nodules Automatic
Classification Algorithms for CT Images


Modern computer vision and machine learning technologies allow very fast and reliable 
CT image classification. 
This research area has become very hot for its high efficiency and labor saving. 
The paper aims to draw a systematic review of the state of the art of automatic 
classification of lung nodules. 
This research paper covers published works selected from the 
Web of Science, IEEEXplore, and DBLP databases up to June 2018
